PREFPAGE_INTRO=Subwords is a new experimental content assist for Java. It uses 'fuzzy word matching' which allows you to specify just a subsequence of the proposal's text you want to insert.\n\n Note that Subwords essentially makes the same proposals as the standard Java content assist, and thus, will automatically disabled itself when either JDT or Mylyn completion is active to avoid duplicated proposals. The button below is a shortcut for enabling Subwords and disabling standard Java and Mylyn content assist (and reverse).
PREFPAGE_SEE_LINK_TO_CONTENT_ASSIST=See %1$s to configure content assist directly.
PREFPAGE_ENABLE_PROPOSALS=Enable Java Subwords Proposals.
