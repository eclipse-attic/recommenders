PREFPAGE_TITLE_SUBWORDS=Subwords
PREFPAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUBWORDS_PREFIX_LENGTH=JDT\u2019s Java Proposals require you to search for proposals by prefix match. \
 Subwords completion relaxes this constraint; you can search for proposals using arbitrary subwords matches. \
 This relaxation, however, may reduce content assist performance, especially when searching for types or constructors. \
 Thus, for these kinds of proposals you can specify a minimum prefix length below.
PREFPAGE_LABEL_PREFIX_LENGTH=Minimum prefix length for types/constructors:
PREFPAGE_TOOLTIP_PREFIX_LENGTH=A value of \u20182\u2019 means that for a prefix like \u2018Str\u2019, subwords completion will propose\n\
 all types starting with \u2018St\u2019 which also contain a subword starting with \u2018r\u2019.\n\n\
 You may tweak this setting if you experience performance issues during content\n\
 assist. A large minimum prefix will make subwords completion behave like JDT\u2019s\n\
 Java Proposals for types and constructors.

PROPOSAL_LABEL_SUBWORDS_COMPLETION_WELCOME=Do you know Subwords Completion?
PROPOSAL_TOOLTIP_SUBWORDS_COMPLETION_WELCOME=Subwords completion allows you to search for subword matches rather than just prefix matches in Content Assist. \
 For example, the proposal \u2018getImage()\u2019 might be suggested when triggering Content Assist with just the prefix \u2018img\u2019.\n\n\
 Subwords completion is enabled by default but you may customize its behavior in the <a href="{1}">{0}</a> preferences. \

LOG_ERROR_EXCEPTION_DURING_CODE_COMPLETION=Exception during code completion
LOG_ERROR_UNEXPECTED_FALLTHROUGH=Found uncovered lazy completion proposal of kind {0} (type \u2018{1}\u2019). \

LOG_ERROR_COMPLETION_CONTEXT_NOT_COLLECTED=Subwords could not be initialized because the completion context for compilation unit \u2018{0}\u2019 could not be collected. \
