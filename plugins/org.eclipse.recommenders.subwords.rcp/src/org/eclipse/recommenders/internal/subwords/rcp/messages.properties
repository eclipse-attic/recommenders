PREFPAGE_TITLE_SUBWORDS=Subwords

PREFPAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUBWORDS_PREFIX_LENGTH= JDT's Java Proposals require you to enter the prefix of the \
 completion to apply. Subwords relaxes this constraint and allows you to specify arbitrary subwords of the \
 proposal you'd like to choose.\n\n\
 This relaxation, however, may reduce content assist performance especially when triggered on type names and\
 constructors. For these proposal types you can specify the minimum prefix length below.
 PREFPAGE_LABEL_PREFIX_LENGTH=Minimum prefix length for types:
 PREFPAGE_TOOLTIP_PREFIX_LENGTH=A value of '2' means that if you enter a prefix like 'Str', subwords\n\
 will propose you every type that starts with 'St' and also contains\n\
 a subword starting with 'r'. \n\n\
 You may tweak this setting if you experience performance issues. Setting\n\
 it to a high value will make Subwords behave like standard JDT completion\n\
 for type and constructor completions.
PROPOSAL_LABEL_ENABLE_SUBWORDS_COMPLETION=Enable subwords completion?
PROPOSAL_TOOLTIP_ENABLE_SUBWORDS_COMPLETION=Subwords completion allows you to search for subword matches rather than just prefix matches in Content Assist. \
 If you want to enable subwords completion, click <a href="{2}">here</a> or simply press Return. \
 You can configure subwords completion in the <a href="{1}">{0}</a> preferences.\n\n\
