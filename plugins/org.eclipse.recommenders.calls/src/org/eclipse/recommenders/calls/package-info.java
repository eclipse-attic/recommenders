/**
 * <h1> Where to start?</h1>
 * 
 *  Start by looking at the following interfaces:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li> {@link org.eclipse.recommenders.calls.ICallModel}
 *  <li> {@link org.eclipse.recommenders.calls.ICallModelProvider}
 *  </ul>
 * 
 * Then continue reading their implementing classes and, if available, and their example usages located in the
 * {@link org.eclipse.recommenders.examples.calls} package.
 * <p>
 * Note that there is no interface <i>ICallRecommender</i> or anything alike. The primary interface to making
 * recommendations is {@link org.eclipse.recommenders.calls.ICallModel}.
